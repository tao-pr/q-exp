# Q-EXP

Hello! Here is a simple implementation of a form of 
[reinforcement learning](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~gasser/Salsa/rl.html) 
called Q learning.  By fundamental design, Q-EXP stands 
for Q-learning Exploration-Exploitation, one among 
common technical terms in reinforcement learning space.

## Implementation

This library is purely written in [ECMAScript 6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) and runs 
with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The implementation paradigm 
of the project tends towards functional programming in order to 
keep operations as simple and highly separable as possible.
